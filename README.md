## About Project

This form boilerplate simplifies creating forms by centralizing the labels and input types in a file.
The file is imported to a component where it loops through and displays the content.

## How to name labels

In data.js, "question" will be the label name. "type" is the input type. You can set the type to be text, checkbox, radio, time, date, or file.
